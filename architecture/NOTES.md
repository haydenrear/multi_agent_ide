# Todo Stuff

We'd like to add a skills file and merge it progressively. I think this means that each orchestrator node, as it 
recurses backward, has a merger node that operates over the previous workers to edit the skills file, with the tool.

I think the skills file is really a proxy for some agentic memory. I like file at first, everything is a file, but 
that's actually a proxy for metadata. Especially for discovery and plan, something like hindsight, or other memory
bank should potentially be used to save something like the wiki of the repo, tickets over the repo, etc. The merger
has to have that all at it's fingertips, and all that.
