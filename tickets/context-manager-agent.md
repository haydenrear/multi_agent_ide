A context manager agent should be able to be routed to when the SomeOf is filled with additional context informations. For example, say they return multiple requests or multiple responses. At that point, the context manager agent can sift through the context and history and tune the context and reroute to the correct agent.

A context manager agent should also be a routing target from ReviewAgent and MergeAgent, because the ReviewAgent and the MergeAgent act as sort of context filters, where nothing really gets through them. So then after these agent, it routes to the context manager agent, and then that agent is provided with all the context items from the past few agents, including the output of the review or merge, and the input to the review or merge, and it's asked to route back to the correct agent with the correct responses. Maybe it doesn't actually need to be an agent call, maybe it can just be a prompt trick where it says, here is what it was, here is what happened, and routes, but can also probably just be an agent context summarizer idea.

A context manager agent should be able to be routed to by any agent as a requester of any arbitrary context in the blackboard history. At that point, the context manager agent's primary role is to reflect, recall, with the memory, search through blackboard history with special tools, embedding tools, etc., and curate additional context provided. For long-running tasks with big amounts of context. This usage and idea of context manager agent fits perfectly with the idea of a tooling that clears the context and curates it, offering interactivity over the context, sort of trading current context for a context, saving context items in the database (and leaving links), and then offering tools over the whole context/blackboard, next, prev, recall, put in memory. 

Imagine an agent interactively interacting with the context, it clicks on a context link, expands it, decides whether to add it to the context, minimizes it, saves it as a memory, searches memory (recalls), it's curating the context, but not only that, it's taking another agent query and curating the context from the history for it, and it's leaving notes for itself in the current context so it knows it minimized this, saved that, has this in the memory, etc. So it fits really well there because by the agent routing to the context manager agent it wipes it's context clear and asks the agent to "rebuild" with a particular intention. A lot of times the context manager agent will just be expanding something, recalling something, searching through blackboard history for something, but this "clear" resets the entire context with an interactivity that works (agent interactivity has typically been winning - the blackboard state functions match **PERFECTLY** for this!).
